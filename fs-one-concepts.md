#### 1. What is Enzyme and what are some of the methods that it provides?
Enzyme is a testing package that can be downloaded into a react app to help make testing easier.


#### 2. What is the difference between dynamic and a static routes?

#### 3. What is a JSON API?

#### 5. Explain how to set up a route in React.

The first step is to import BrowserRouter, Route, Link from react-router-dom.
The next step is to create a path for each of the web pages.

#### 6. When would you use a generate resource over a generate controller?

generating a controller only gies you a controller. When we generate a resource, it gives us what we need in order to delete, update, create and read information.

#### 7. Explain the difference between a controller spec and a request spec.

Google: 
Controller specs are RSpec wrappers for Rails functional tests. 
They simulate a single HTTP request in each example.
By default views are not rendered; the controller spec stubs views with a template that renders an empty string (the template must exist). 
As you only call a controller action, only the controller is tested. 
Request specs are RSpec wrappers for Rails integration tests.
They are designed to test the entire stack, including routing.
You can specify single or multiple requests across multiple controllers or sessions.

#### 8. Describe the React component lifecycle. What are some of the lifecycle methods?

A React component lifecycle is from when it is called, to when it is rendered and when the page is loaded. It is primarily made up of these three phases, Mounting, Updating and Unmounting.

#### 9. At this point in the program, what technologies/languages do you find yourself gravitating to?

I find myself gravitating more towards react and javascript because I like working with the front end. I am also open to work with ruby and rails if I am presented with a good opportunity.
